          <p class="line">When I'm not coding I am often found building Gundam models, another time consuming pass time with great rewards for patience and persistence. <p>
          
          <p class="line">Hopefully what is now (in early 2024) a newly found interest for me can blossom into a new world of possibilites, and this portfolio will only get better with time.
             I'm already excited to look back on this project one day and see the progress I have made.</p></p>
